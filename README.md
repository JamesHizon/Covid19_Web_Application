# Covid19 Web Application
This project was created for my STA 141B Final Project. The following application is simple, yet effective for analyzing time-series cases of multiple variables such as confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recovered cases. In addition, we can choose to examine a single country at a given time. Initially, we start at analysis of the Philippines, because I personally was affected by COVID-19 while leaving my vacation trip a week early.
