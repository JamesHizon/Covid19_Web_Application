# Covid19 Web Application
This project was created for my STA 141B Final Project. The following application is simple, yet effective for analyzing time-series cases of multiple variables such as confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recovered cases. In addition, we can choose to examine a single country at a given time. Initially, we start at analysis of the Philippines, because I personally was affected by COVID-19 while leaving my vacation trip a week early.

In the analysis of our data for the Philippines, we can see the number of reported cases of each type starting to increase at the end of March. The rate of increase for each case type all share a similar trend of increase. Surprisingly, as we study the data for the United States, we can observe that confirmed and recovered cases have a constant trend of increase, whereas the rate of increase for active cases and deaths become slightly lesser as we approach June. This can lead to assumptions such as seasonality, by which COVID-19 may not have as strong of an impact when temperature rises. Another assumption is that COVID-19 social distancing efforts may have led to success to slow the spread of the virus.
